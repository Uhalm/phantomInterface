# Phantom Interface

Phantom Interface allows for easier use of the phantom software by jhead providing a text base user interface.

To run download the zip file, unzip, and install python (python.org) and open the PI.py file.
If you on linux run the setup before connecting.
Once connected to the server (if it failed you will be booted to the main menu) launch Minecraft and select the server from the LAN list.

Does not work with the Switch
